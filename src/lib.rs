//! Idiomatic inotify wrapper for the Rust programming language
//!
//! # About
//!
//! [inotify-rs] is an idiomatic wrapper around the Linux kernel's [inotify] API
//! for the Rust programming language. It can be used for monitoring changes to
//! files or directories.
//!
//! The [`Inotify`] struct is the main entry point into the API.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use inotify::{
//!     Inotify,
//!     WatchMask,
//! };
//!
//! let mut inotify = Inotify::init()
//!     .expect("Error while initializing inotify instance");
//!
//! # // Create a temporary file, so `add_watch` won't return an error.
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! # let mut test_file = File::create("/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file")
//! #     .expect("Failed to create test file");
//! #
//! // Watch for modify and close events.
//! inotify
//!     .add_watch(
//!         "/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file",
//!         WatchMask::MODIFY | WatchMask::CLOSE,
//!     )
//!     .expect("Failed to add file watch");
//!
//! # // Modify file, so the following `read_events_blocking` won't block.
//! # use std::io::Write;
//! # write!(&mut test_file, "something\n")
//! #     .expect("Failed to write something to test file");
//! #
//! // Read events that were added with `add_watch` above.
//! let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
//! let events = inotify.read_events_blocking(&mut buffer)
//!     .expect("Error while reading events");
//!
//! for event in events {
//!     // Handle event
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Attention: inotify gotchas
//!
//! inotify (as in, the Linux API, not this wrapper) has many edge cases, making
//! it hard to use correctly. This can lead to weird and hard to find bugs in
//! applications that are based on it. inotify-rs does its best to fix these
//! issues, but sometimes this would require an amount of runtime overhead that
//! is just unacceptable for a low-level wrapper such as this.
//!
//! We've documented any issues that inotify-rs has inherited from inotify, as
//! far as we are aware of them. Please watch out for any further warnings
//! throughout this documentation. If you want to be on the safe side, in case
//! we have missed something, please read the [inotify man pages] carefully.

    /// #     Inotify,
    /// #     WatchMask,
    /// # };
    /// #
    /// # let mut inotify = Inotify::init().unwrap();
    /// #
    /// # // Create a temporary file, so `add_watch` won't return an error.
    /// # use std::fs::File;
    /// # File::create("/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file")

    /// #
    /// inotify.add_watch("/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file", WatchMask::ACCESS)
    ///    .expect("Error adding watch");
